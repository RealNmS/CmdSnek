### Terminal-based Snake game written in Python.

Simple but interactive snake game written in Python played in the terminal. I had some free time during Python classes, so I made this. I might update this a few times to fix bugs or make it look better. Should work but not tested on Linux (I'm still a begginer in these things so idk what does and doesn't work lol).

- Used Python 3.13.2
- Took about 8 hours (4h was me just looking at the code not doing anything)
